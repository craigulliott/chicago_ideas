        %p Luftwerk creates new media art installations by merging video projection, light, sound, material and elemental surfaces. The interest of the collaborative vision of Petra Bachmaier and Sean Gallero is to transform material and space into a moving canvas, intersecting the perception of science, nature and the built environment of architecture. Expansive installations and extensive environments immerse the viewer within theme, imagery, motion, shadow and light. The site-specific projects of the duo have been presented in diverse locations as Frank Lloyd Wrightâ€™s Fallingwater, Millennium Park, Chicago Cultural Center, JFK Airport, and Las Vegas.
