These awards were created to acknowledge some of Chicago's most innovative individuals, as distinguished by their use of new ideas and the positive, measurable impact they have in the community. Winners will receive special recognition by community leaders during Chicago Ideas Week and the best seats in the house for the Edison Talks, a highlight of Chicago Ideas Week.

        %h2 Heroes Prize
        %p A hero is a person who risks something of his or her own to improve the life of another. Chicago Ideas Week honors heroes from our community and around the globe who inspire us to do better and be better doers.
