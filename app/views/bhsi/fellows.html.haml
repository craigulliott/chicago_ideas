            Mark Arnoldy, 25, is the Executive Director of Nyaya Health (<a href="http://www.nyayahealth.org/">www.nyayahealth.org</a>), a NGO that delivers health care to the poor in rural Nepal. After nearly dying on his 1st trip to Nepal from lack of access to health care following a severe allergic reaction, Mark was afforded a rare glimpse of empathy with the millions of Nepalis who were being denied care. In partnership with the Nepali government, Nyaya now manages one of the country's largest hospitals, providing care to tens of thousands of patients each year. A native of St. Louis Missouri, he is a graduate of Harvard's Global Health Effectiveness Program and a former Fulbright Scholar to Nepal.
