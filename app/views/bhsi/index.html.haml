        %p The Bluhm/Helfand Social Innovation Fellowship @ Chicago Ideas Week will recognize three young socially-conscious leaders who have developed sustainable ventures addressing social needs, and provide them with exposure to nationally recognized business and community leaders, funding to support their cause, and a platform for growth. 
        %p The Fellowship was created by philanthropists and entrepreneurs Leslie Bluhm and David Helfand to help advance the next generation of socially-minded innovators, entrepreneurs and change agents. In 2011, the fellowship received over 200 applications and brought an outstanding group of social innovators to Chicago for the first ever Chicago Ideas Week.
        %h2 The Program
        %p The three fellowship recipients will be hosted in Chicago for Chicago Ideas Week, taking place October 8-14 2012, all expenses paid. Fellows will gain exposure for their organization, establish a community of support, and receive a $10,000 financial contribution for their venture.
